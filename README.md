# Digital-Clock-
This is an embedded software project. I made a clock using a digital display and an arduino uno.

This project is cool because I'm learning a lot about I2C, and I'm gettign familiar with the Wire library for arduino projects. I might go back and make this project on an STM32 or some other board just for the experience.
